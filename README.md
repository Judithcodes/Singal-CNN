Introduction
---
This project is an implenmentation of paper: [Convolutional Radio Modulation Recognition Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04105)<br>
A trained model file for this code is given [in dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y3dbhcct7krapr6/convmodrecnets_CNN2_0.5.wts.h5?dl=0) and [Baidu drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1i48XyYT)<br>  
This is a modified version editted with spyder
Requirement 
* Keras 2.0.4 with TensorFlow1.0 
* Anaconda3(python3.5 or 3.6)

TODO:<br> 
add more details
